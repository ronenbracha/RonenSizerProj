Ronen's Sizer task

Resizing Logic: 
The image is scaled down to fill the given width and height while retaining the
original aspect ratio and with all of the original image visible. If the requested
dimensions are bigger than the original image&#39;s, the image doesnâ€™t scale up. If
the proportions of the original image do not match the given width and height,
black padding is added to the image to reach the required size.
